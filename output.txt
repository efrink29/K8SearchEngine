 the  dog  ( canis familiaris  or  canis lupus familiaris ) is a  domesticated  descendant of the  wolf . also called the  domestic dog , it was  selectively bred  from an  extinct  population of wolves during the  late pleistocene  by  hunter-gatherers . the dog was the first  species  to be domesticated by  humans , over 14,000 years ago and before the  development of agriculture . experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a  starch -rich diet that would be inadequate for other  canids . dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  dog breeds  vary widely in shape, size, and color. they have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed  senses of smell , hearing, and sight. compared to humans, dogs have an inferior  visual acuity , a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large  olfactory cortex . they perform many roles for humans, such as  hunting ,  herding ,  pulling loads ,  protection ,  companionship ,  therapy ,  aiding disabled people , and  assisting police  and the  military . communication in dogs  includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). they mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. as such, the  human–canine bond  has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the  sobriquet  of " man's best friend ". the global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion,  distributed around the world . the dog is the most popular pet in the united states, present in 34–40% of households. developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.

 cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives [ 4 ] 
 dogs are domesticated members of the family  canidae . they are classified as a  subspecies of  canis lupus , along with  wolves  and  dingoes . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  dogs were domesticated from wolves over 14,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers , before the development of agriculture. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  the remains of the  bonn–oberkassel dog , buried alongside humans between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, are the earliest to be conclusively identified as a domesticated dog. [ 9 ] [ 7 ]  genetic studies show that dogs likely diverged from wolves between 27,000 and 40,000 years ago. [ 10 ]  the dingo and the related  new guinea singing dog  resulted from the  geographic isolation  and feralization of dogs in  oceania  over 8,000 years ago. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] dogs, wolves, and dingoes have sometimes been classified as separate species. [ 6 ]  in 1758, the swedish botanist and zoologist  carl linnaeus  assigned the  genus  name  canis  (which is the  latin  word for "dog") [ 13 ]  to the domestic dog, the  wolf , and the  golden jackal  in his book,  systema naturae . he classified the domestic dog as  canis familiaris  and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as  canis lupus . [ 2 ]  linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail ( cauda recurvata  in  latin  term), which is not found in any other  canid . [ 14 ]  in the 2005 edition of  mammal species of the world ,  mammalogist   w. christopher wozencraft  listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of  canis lupus  and proposed two additional subspecies:  familiaris , as named by linnaeus in 1758, and  dingo , named by meyer in 1793. wozencraft included  hallstromi  (the new guinea singing dog) as another name ( junior synonym ) for the dingo. this classification was informed by a 1999  mitochondrial dna  study. [ 3 ] the classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in australia. classifying dingoes as wild dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. treating dingoes as a separate species allows conservation programs to protect the dingo population. [ 15 ]  dingo classification affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes. [ 16 ]  in 2019, a workshop hosted by the  iucn /species survival commission's canid specialist group considered the dingo and the new guinea singing dog to be  feral   canis familiaris . therefore, it did not assess them for the  iucn red list  of  threatened species . [ 17 ] 
 domestication 
  main article:  domestication of the dog 
 wolves (left) were domesticated by humans into dogs (right) 
 the earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in  bonn-oberkassel , germany.  contextual ,  isotopic ,  genetic , and  morphological  evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf. [ 18 ]  the dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red  hematite  powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. the dog had died of  canine distemper . [ 19 ]  this timing indicates that the dog was the  first species to be domesticated [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  in the time of  hunter-gatherers , [ 22 ]  which predates agriculture. [ 1 ]  earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as  paleolithic dogs , but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated [ 23 ]  because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the  late pleistocene . [ 1 ] dna sequences  show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any  modern wolf  lineage. some studies have posited that all living wolves are more closely related to each other than to dogs, [ 24 ] [ 22 ]  while others have suggested that dogs are more closely related to modern eurasian wolves than to american wolves. [ 25 ] the dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a  commensal  pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps). [ 23 ] [ 26 ]  the questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated remains uncertain. [ 20 ]  genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either europe, the high arctic, or eastern asia. [ 27 ]  in 2021, a  literature review  of the current evidence  infers  that the dog was domesticated in  siberia  23,000 years ago by  ancient north siberians , then later dispersed eastward into the americas and westward across eurasia, [ 18 ]  with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the americas. [ 18 ]  some studies have suggested that the extinct  japanese wolf  is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs. [ 25 ] in 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves. as the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation. these genes are linked to  neural crest  and  central nervous system  development. these genes affect  embryogenesis  and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome. the study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior. this trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs. [ 28 ] 
 breeds 
  main article:  dog breed 
  further information:  dog type there are around 450 official  dog breeds , the most of any mammal. [ 27 ] [ 29 ]  dogs began diversifying in the  victorian era , when humans took control of their natural selection. [ 21 ]  most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years. [ 21 ] [ 27 ]  since then, dogs have undergone rapid  phenotypic change  and have been subjected to  artificial selection  by humans. the skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of  carnivores . these breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour. [ 21 ]  as such, humans have long used dogs for their desirable traits to complete or fulfill a certain work or role. their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting, [ 21 ]  retrieving, and scent detection. their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression. [ 21 ]  present-day dogs are dispersed around the world. [ 27 ]  an example of this dispersal is the numerous modern breeds of european lineage during the victorian era.

 anatomy and physiology 
  main article:  dog anatomy 
 size and skeleton 
 a lateral view of a dog skeleton 
 dogs are extremely variable in size, ranging from one of the largest breeds, the  great dane , at 50 to 79 kg (110 to 174 lb) and 71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 in), to one of the smallest, the  chihuahua , at 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb) and 13 to 20 cm (5.1 to 7.9 in). [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  all healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have the same amount of bones (with the exception of the tail), although there is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types. [ 32 ] [ 33 ]  the dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the  vertebrae  on the neck and back have extensions for back muscles, consisting of  epaxial muscles and hypaxial muscles , to connect to; the long ribs provide room for the  heart  and  lungs ; and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton, allowing for flexibility. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as  mastiffs  and miniaturised for smaller types such as  terriers ;  dwarfism  has been selectively bred for some types where short legs are preferred, such as  dachshunds  and  corgis . [ 33 ]  most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with  naturally short tails  have as few as three. [ 32 ] 
 skulls of different breeds, from left to right: pug; boxer; rottweiler; wolf; collie; standard poodle. 
 the dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant  divergence in terms of skull shape  between types. [ 33 ] [ 35 ]  the three basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in  sighthounds , the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls. [ 33 ] [ 35 ]  the jaw contains around 42 teeth, and it has evolved for the consumption of flesh. dogs use their  carnassial teeth  to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat. [ 36 ] 
 senses 
  further information:  dog anatomy § senses 
 the left half of the image shows the estimated difference in a dog's vision. 
 dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and  magnetoreception . one study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in  earth's magnetic field . [ 37 ]  dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north–south position in calm  magnetic field  conditions. [ 38 ] dogs' vision is  dichromatic ; their visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays. [ 39 ]  they have difficulty differentiating between red and green, [ 40 ]  and much like other mammals, the dog's eye is composed of two types of cone cells compared to the human's three. the divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12 to 25°, depending on the breed, which can have different retina configurations. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  the  fovea centralis  area of the eye is attached to a  nerve fiber , and is the most sensitive to  photons . [ 43 ]  additionally, a study found that dogs'  visual acuity  was up to eight times less effective than a human, and their ability to discriminate levels of  brightness  was about two times worse than a human. [ 44 ] while the human brain is dominated by a large  visual cortex , the dog brain is dominated by a large  olfactory cortex . dogs have roughly forty times more  smell-sensitive receptors  than humans, ranging from about 125  million to nearly 300  million in some dog breeds, such as  bloodhounds . [ 45 ]  this sense of smell is the most prominent sense of the species; it detects chemical changes in the environment, allowing dogs to pinpoint the location of mating partners, potential stressors, resources, etc. [ 46 ]  dogs also have an acute sense of hearing up to four times greater than that of humans. they can pick up the slightest sounds from about 400 m (1,300 ft) compared to 90 m (300 ft) for humans. [ 47 ] dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as  whiskers  that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions. the lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw. whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth. [ 48 ] 
 coat 
  main article:  dog coat the  coats  of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse  guard hair  and a soft  down hair , or "single", with the topcoat only. breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside. [ 49 ]  premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with  impulsive behaviors ,  anxiety  behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals. [ 50 ]  some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. the coats of certain breeds are often groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the  yorkshire terrier 's "show cut". [ 36 ] dewclaw 
 a dog's  dewclaw  is the fifth  digit  in its forelimb and hind legs. dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin. most dogs aren't born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. dogs' dewclaws consist of the  proximal phalanges and distal phalanges . some publications theorize that dewclaws in wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] 
 tail 
 a dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the  vertebral column , which is made up of a string of 5 to 23  vertebrae  enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles. one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state. [ 53 ]  the tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the opposite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its  anal gland 's scent through the tail's position and movement. [ 54 ]  dogs can have a  violet gland  (or supracaudal gland) characterized by  sebaceous glands  on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent. the enlargement of the violet gland in the tail, which can create a  bald spot from hair loss , can be caused by  cushing's disease  or an excess of sebum from  androgens  in the sebaceous glands. [ 55 ] 
 a black  standard schnauzer  with a docked tail 
 a study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli. "stimuli that could be expected to elicit approach tendencies seem to be associated with [a] higher amplitude of tail-wagging movements to the right side". [ 56 ] [ 57 ]  dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called  kennel tail ,  happy tail ,  bleeding tail , or  splitting tail . [ 58 ]  in some  hunting dogs , the tail is traditionally  docked  to avoid injuries. some dogs can be born without tails because of a dna variant in the  t gene , which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail. [ 59 ]  tail docking is opposed by many veterinary and animal welfare organisations such as the  american veterinary medical association [ 60 ]  and the  british veterinary association . [ 61 ]  evidence from veterinary practices and  questionnaires  showed that around 500 dogs would need to have their tail docked to prevent one injury. [ 62 ] 
 health 
  main article:  dog health 
 numerous disorders have been known to affect dogs. some are  congenital  and others are acquired. dogs can acquire upper respiratory tract diseases including diseases that affect the  nasal cavity , the  larynx , and the  trachea ; lower respiratory tract diseases which includes  pulmonary disease  and acute respiratory diseases;  heart diseases  which includes any  cardiovascular  inflammation or dysfunction of the heart;  haemopoietic diseases  including  anaemia  and  clotting disorders ;  gastrointestinal disease  such as  diarrhoea  and  gastric dilatation volvulus ;  hepatic disease  such as  portosystemic shunts  and  liver failure ;  pancreatic disease  such as  pancreatitis ;  renal disease ; lower urinary tract disease such as  cystitis  and  urolithiasis ;  endocrine disorders  such as  diabetes mellitus ,  cushing's syndrome ,  hypoadrenocorticism , and  hypothyroidism ;  nervous system  diseases such as  seizures  and  spinal injury ;  musculoskeletal disease  such as  arthritis  and  myopathies ;  dermatological disorders  such as  alopecia  and  pyoderma ;  ophthalmological diseases  such as  conjunctivitis ,  glaucoma ,  entropion , and  progressive retinal atrophy ; and  neoplasia . [ 63 ] common dog parasites are  lice ,  fleas ,  fly larvae ,  ticks ,  mites ,  cestodes ,  nematodes , and  coccidia .  taenia  is a notable genus with 5 species in which dogs are the  definitive host . [ 64 ]  additionally, dogs are a source of  zoonoses  for humans. they are responsible for 99% of  rabies  cases worldwide; [ 65 ]  however, in some developed countries such as the uk, rabies is absent from dogs and is instead only transmitted by bats. [ 66 ]  other common zoonoses are  hydatid disease ,  leptospirosis ,  pasteurellosis ,  ringworm , and  toxocariasis . [ 66 ]  common infections in dogs include  canine adenovirus ,  canine distemper virus ,  canine parvovirus ,  leptospirosis ,  canine influenza , and  canine coronavirus . all of these conditions have vaccines available. [ 66 ] dogs are the companion animal most frequently reported for exposure to  toxins . most poisonings are accidental and over 80% of reports of exposure to the  aspca  animal poisoning hotline are due to oral exposure. the most common substances people report exposure to are: pharmaceuticals, toxic foods, and  rodenticides . [ 67 ]  data from the pet poison helpline shows that human drugs are the most frequent cause of toxicosis death. the most common household products ingested are cleaning products. most food related poisonings involved  theobromine poisoning  (chocolate). other common food poisonings include  xylitol ,  vitis  (grapes, raisins, etc.) and  allium  (garlic, onions, etc.).  pyrethrin  insecticides were the most common cause of pesticide poisoning.  metaldehyde  a common pesticide for snails and slugs typically causes severe outcomes when ingested by dogs. [ 68 ] neoplasia  is the most common cause of death for dogs. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  other common causes of death are  heart  and  renal failure . [ 71 ]  their  pathology  is similar to that of humans, as is their  response  to treatment and their outcomes. genes found in humans to be responsible for disorders are investigated in dogs as being the cause and vice versa. [ 27 ] [ 72 ] 
 lifespan 
  further information:  aging in dogs 
 the typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but the median longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years. [ 73 ] [ 74 ]  obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs to have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight. [ 73 ] in a 2024 uk study analyzing 584,734 dogs, it was concluded that purebred dogs lived longer than crossbred dogs, challenging the previous notion of the latter having the higher life expectancies. the authors noted that their study included " designer dogs " as crossbred and that purebred dogs were typically given better care than their crossbred counterparts, which likely influenced the outcome of the study. [ 75 ]  other studies also show that fully mongrel dogs live about a year longer on average than dogs with pedigrees. [ 76 ]  furthermore, small dogs with longer muzzles have been shown to have higher lifespans than larger medium-sized dogs with much more depressed muzzles. [ 77 ]  for free-ranging dogs, less than 1 in 5 reach sexual maturity, [ 78 ]  and the median life expectancy for feral dogs is less than half of dogs living with humans. [ 79 ] 
 reproduction 
  main article:  canine reproduction 
 two dogs  tied after mating 
 in domestic dogs,  sexual maturity  happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds. this is the time at which female dogs will have their first  estrous cycle , characterized by their  vulvas  swelling and producing  discharges , usually lasting between 4 and 20 days. [ 80 ] [ 81 ]  they will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for  pregnancy . at the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to  copulation . because the  ova  survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter. [ 82 ]  fertilization typically occurs two to five days after ovulation. after  ejaculation , the dogs are  coitally tied  for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's  bulbus glandis  swelling and the female's  constrictor vestibuli  contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to  muscle relaxation . [ 83 ]  14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the  uterus , and after seven to eight more days, a heartbeat is detectable. [ 84 ] [ 85 ]  dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after  fertilization , [ 82 ] [ 86 ]  with an average of 63 days, although the length of  gestation  can vary. an average litter consists of about six  puppies . [ 87 ] 
 neutering 
 neutering  is the sterilization of animals via  gonadectomy , which is an  orchidectomy  (castration) in dogs and  ovariohysterectomy  (spay) in bitches. neutering reduces problems caused by  hypersexuality , especially in male dogs. [ 88 ]  spayed females are less likely to develop  cancers  affecting the  mammary glands ,  ovaries , and other  reproductive organs . [ 89 ]  however, neutering increases the risk of  urinary incontinence  in bitches, [ 90 ]   prostate cancer  in dogs, [ 91 ]  and  osteosarcoma ,  hemangiosarcoma ,  cruciate ligament rupture ,  pyometra ,  obesity , and  diabetes mellitus  in either sex. [ 92 ] neutering is the most common surgical procedure in dogs less than a year old in the us and is seen as a control method for overpopulation. neutering often occurs as early as 6–14 weeks in shelters in the us. [ 93 ]  the  american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  (aspca) advises that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized. [ 94 ] [ 95 ]  however, the society for theriogenology and the american college of theriogenologists made a joint statement that opposes mandatory neutering; they said that the cause of overpopulation in the us is cultural. [ 93 ] neutering is less common in most european countries, especially in  nordic countries —except for the uk, where it is common. in norway, neutering is illegal unless for the benefit of the animal's health (e.g., ovariohysterectomy in case of ovarian or uterine neoplasia). some european countries have similar laws to norway, but their wording either explicitly allows for neutering for controlling reproduction or it is allowed in practice or by contradiction through other laws. italy and portugal have passed recent laws that promote it. germany forbids early age neutering, but neutering is still allowed at the usual age. in romania, neutering is mandatory except for when a pedigree to select breeds can be shown. [ 93 ] [ 96 ] 
 inbreeding depression 
  see also:  inbreeding depression 
 a common breeding practice for pet dogs is to  mate them between close relatives  (e.g., between half- and full-siblings). [ 97 ]  in a study of seven dog breeds (the  bernese mountain dog ,  basset hound ,  cairn terrier ,  brittany ,  german shepherd dog ,  leonberger , and  west highland white terrier ), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. [ 98 ]  another analysis of data on 42,855  dachshund  litters found that as the  inbreeding coefficient  increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. [ 99 ]  in a study of  boxer  litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding. [ 100 ] 
  
 behavior 
  main article:  dog behavior 
  see also:  dog behavior § behavior compared with other canids 
 dog behavior  has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. they have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. [ 101 ] [ 102 ]  behavioral scientists suggest that a set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as  great apes , are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills. [ 103 ] most domestic animals were initially bred for the production of goods. dogs, on the other hand, were selectively bred for desirable behavioral traits. [ 104 ] [ 105 ]  in 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. [ 106 ]  these gene variations indicate the occurrence of  artificial selection  and the subsequent divergence of behavior and anatomical features. these genes have been shown to affect the  catecholamine synthesis  pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the  fight-or-flight response [ 105 ] [ 107 ]  (i.e., selection for  tameness ) and emotional processing. [ 105 ]  compared to their wolf counterparts, dogs tend to be less timid and less aggressive, though some of these genes have been associated with aggression in certain dog breeds. [ 108 ] [ 105 ]  traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to  williams-beuren syndrome  in humans, which cause  hypersociability  at the expense of  problem-solving ability . [ 109 ]  in a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -like showed lower  serotonin  and  dopamine  concentrations. [ 110 ]  a similar study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs. [ 111 ]  a dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable. [ 112 ]   acute stress reactions  from  post-traumatic stress disorder  (ptsd) seen in dogs can evolve into  chronic stress . [ 113 ]  police dogs with ptsd can often refuse to work. [ 114 ] dog swimming over to catch a ball 
 dogs have a natural instinct called  prey drive  (the term is chiefly used to describe  training dogs ' habits) which can be influenced by breeding. these instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals to be prey or drive possessive behavior. these traits have been enhanced in some breeds so that they may be used to hunt and kill  vermin  or other pests. [ 115 ]  puppies or dogs sometimes  bury food underground . one study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches, likely due to a "difference in motivation" between wolves and dogs. [ 116 ]  some puppies and dogs engage in  coprophagy  out of habit, stress, for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. a study hypothesizes that the behavior was inherited from wolves, a behavior likely evolved to lessen the presence of  intestinal parasites  in dens. [ 117 ]  most dogs can swim. in a study of 412 dogs, around 36.5% of the dogs could not swim; the other 63.5% were able to swim without a trainer in a  swimming pool . [ 118 ]  a study of 55 dogs found a correlation between swimming and 'improvement' of the hip  osteoarthritis joint . [ 119 ] 
 nursing 
 a female dog nursing her newborn puppies. 
 the female dog may produce  colostrum , a type of milk high in nutrients and antibodies, 1–7 days before giving birth. milk production lasts for around three months, [ 120 ] [ 121 ]  and increases with litter size. [ 121 ]  the dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during  child contractions . [ 122 ]  in the later stages of the dog's pregnancy,  nesting behaviour  may occur. [ 123 ]  puppies are born with a  protective fetal membrane  that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their hormonal state. [ 124 ] [ 125 ]  while male-parent dogs can show more disinterested behaviour toward their own puppies, [ 126 ]  most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans. [ 127 ]  a female dog may abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is stressed or in pain. [ 128 ] 
 intelligence 
  main article:  dog intelligence 
 researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by  inference . a study with  rico , a  border collie , showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. he inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. a study of another border collie, chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words. [ 129 ] one study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of  horses ,  chimpanzees , or  cats . [ 130 ]  one study of 18 household dogs found that the dogs could not distinguish food bowls at specific locations without distinguishing cues; the study stated that this indicates a lack of  spatial memory . [ 131 ]  a study stated that dogs have a  visual sense for number . the dogs showed a ratio-dependent  activation  both for numerical values from 1–3 to larger than four. [ 132 ] dogs demonstrate a  theory of mind  by engaging in deception. [ 133 ]  another experimental study showed evidence that australian  dingos  can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. [ 134 ]  another study showed that dogs stared at humans after failing to complete an impossible version of the same task they had been trained to solve. wolves, under the same situation, avoided staring at humans altogether. [ 135 ] 
 communication

 dog communication is the transfer of information between dogs, as well as between dogs and humans. [ 136 ]  communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, [ 137 ] [ 138 ]  vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). dogs mark their  territories  by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. [ 139 ] [ 140 ]  both sexes of dogs may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing situations. [ 141 ]  aroused dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher  cortisol  levels. [ 142 ]  dogs begin socializing with other dogs by the time they reach the ages of 3 to 8 weeks, and at about 5 to 12 weeks of age, they alter their focus from dogs to humans. [ 143 ]  belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a bite or to seek comfort. [ 144 ] humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. with their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive  barking  patterns that convey different messages. a study using  functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fmri) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal voices using the brain's region towards the  temporal pole , similar to that of humans' brains. most dogs also looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the  valence of vocalization . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ]  a study of  caudate responses  shows that dogs tend to respond more positively to social rewards than to food rewards. [ 148 ] 
 ecology 
 population 
 the dog is the most widely abundant large  carnivoran  living in the human environment. [ 149 ] [ 150 ]  in 2020, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million and 1 billion. [ 151 ]  in the same year, a study found the dog to be the most popular pet in the united states, as they were present in 34 out of every 100 homes. [ 5 ]  about 20% of the dog population live in  developed countries . [ 152 ]  in the  developing world , it is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as  feral ,  village , or community dogs. [ 153 ]  most of these dogs live as  scavengers  and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%). [ 154 ] 
 competitors 
 feral and  free-ranging dogs ' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. [ 149 ]  although wolves are known to kill dogs, wolves tend to live in pairs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage when facing large dog groups. [ 155 ] [ 156 ]  in some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. [ 157 ]  although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, there is still a fear among humans of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations. [ 155 ] coyotes  and  big cats  have also been known to attack dogs. in particular,  leopards  are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter their size. [ 158 ]   siberian tigers  in the  amur river  region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. they will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way. [ 159 ]   striped hyenas  are known to kill dogs in their range. [ 160 ]  dogs as introduced predators have affected the ecology of  new zealand , which lacked indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement. [ 161 ]  dogs have made 11  vertebrate  species extinct and are identified as a 'potential threat' to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. [ 162 ]  dogs have also been linked to the extinction of 156 animal species. [ 163 ]  dogs have been documented to have killed a few birds of the endangered species, the  kagu , in  new caledonia . [ 164 ] 
 diet

 dogs are typically described as  omnivores . [ 82 ] [ 165 ] [ 166 ]  compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have  extra copies of amylase  and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet. [ 167 ]  similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their  saliva  and are classified as having a high-starch diet. [ 168 ]  despite being an omnivore, dogs are only able to conjugate  bile acid  with  taurine . they must get  vitamin d  from their diet. [ 169 ] of the  twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms  (including  selenocysteine ), dogs cannot synthesize ten:  arginine ,  histidine ,  isoleucine ,  leucine ,  lysine ,  methionine ,  phenylalanine ,  threonine ,  tryptophan , and  valine . [ 170 ] [ 171 ] [ 172 ]  like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain  nitrogen balance . these nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores. [ 173 ] 
 range 
 as a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog has notable exceptions of presence in: 
 the  aboriginal tasmanians , who were separated from australia before the arrival of  dingos  on that continent [ 174 ] 
 the  andamanese peoples , who were isolated when  rising sea levels  covered the  land bridge  to myanmar [ 175 ] [ 176 ] 
 the  fuegians , who instead domesticated the  fuegian dog , an already extinct different canid species [ 177 ] 
 individual pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs or where the dogs died out after original settlement, notably the  mariana islands , [ 178 ]   palau [ 179 ]  and most of the  caroline islands  with exceptions such as  fais island  and  nukuoro , [ 180 ]  the  marshall islands , [ 181 ]  the  gilbert islands , [ 181 ]   new caledonia , [ 182 ]   vanuatu , [ 182 ] [ 183 ]   tonga , [ 183 ]   marquesas , [ 183 ]   mangaia  in the  cook islands ,  rapa iti  in  french polynesia ,  easter island , [ 183 ]  the  chatham islands , [ 184 ]  and  pitcairn island  (settled by the  bounty  mutineers , who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships). [ 185 ] dogs were introduced to  antarctica  as  sled dogs . starting practice in december 1993, dogs were later outlawed by the  protocol on environmental protection to the antarctic treaty international agreement  due to the possible risk of spreading infections. [ 186 ]  
 roles with humans 
  main article:  human–canine bond 
 the  domesticated dog  originated as a  predator  and  scavenger . [ 187 ] [ 188 ]  they inherited complex behaviors, such as  bite inhibition , from their wolf ancestors, which would have been  pack hunters  with complex  body language . these sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for dogs' trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, [ 189 ]  and probably also their co-existence with early human hunter-gatherers. [ 190 ] [ 191 ]  dogs perform many roles for people, such as  hunting ,  herding ,  pulling loads ,  protection ,  assisting police  and the  military ,  companionship , and  aiding disabled individuals . these roles in human society have earned them the nickname " man's best friend " in the  western world . in some cultures, however, dogs  are also a source of meat . [ 192 ] [ 193 ] 
 pets 
 a  siberian husky  with a human companion 
 the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. [ 194 ]  pet-dog populations grew significantly after  world war ii  as  suburbanization  increased. [ 194 ]  in the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased role of dogs in the  emotional support  of their human guardians. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] [ 197 ]  within the second half of the 20th century, more and more dog owners considered their animal to be a part of the family. this major social status shift allowed the dog to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior. [ 197 ]  the second has been the broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices. [ 197 ] products such as dog-training books, classes, and television programs, target dog owners. [ 198 ] [ 199 ]  some dog-trainers have promoted a  dominance model  of dog-human relationships. however, the idea of the  "alpha dog"  trying to be dominant is based on a controversial theory about wolf packs. [ 200 ] [ 201 ]  it has been disputed that "trying to achieve status" is characteristic of dog-human interactions. [ 202 ]  human family members have increased participation in activities in which the dog is an integral partner, such as  dog dancing  and  dog yoga . [ 198 ] according to statistics published by the  american pet products manufacturers association  in the national pet owner survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the united states have pet dogs. [ 203 ]  the source shows that nearly 40% of american households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. the data also shows an equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one-fifth of the owned dogs come from  shelters . [ 204 ] 
 workers 
 in addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for  herding livestock  (such as  collies  and  sheepdogs ); for hunting; for  rodent control  (such as terriers); as  search and rescue dogs ; [ 205 ] [ 206 ]  as  detection dogs  (such as those trained to detect  illicit drugs  or  chemical weapons ); [ 207 ] [ 208 ]  as homeguard dogs; as  police dogs  (sometimes nicknamed "k-9"); as  welfare-purpose dogs ; as dogs who assist fishermen retrieve their nets; and as dogs that pull loads (such as  sled dogs ). [ 82 ]  in 1957, the dog  laika  became one of the first animals to be launched into  earth orbit  aboard the  soviets 's  sputnik 2 ; laika died during the flight from  overheating . [ 209 ] [ 210 ]  various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including  guide dogs ,  hearing dogs ,  mobility assistance dogs , and  psychiatric service dogs , assist individuals with disabilities. [ 211 ] [ 212 ]  a study of 29 dogs found that 9 dogs owned by people with epilepsy were reported to exhibit attention-getting behavior to their handler 30 seconds to 45 minutes prior to an impending seizure; there was no significant correlation between the patients' demographics, health, or attitude towards their pets. [ 213 ] 
 shows and sports 
  see also:  dog show 
 dogs compete in breed-conformation shows and  dog sports  (including  racing ,  sledding , and  agility competitions ). in dog shows, also referred to as "breed shows", a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in a  breed standard . [ 214 ]   weight pulling , a dog sport involving pulling weight, has been criticized for promoting  doping  and for its risk of injury. [ 215 ] 
 dogs as food 
  main article:  dog meat 
 humans have consumed dog meat going back at least 14,000 years. it's unknown to what extent prehistoric dogs were consumed and bred for meat. for centuries, the practice was prevalent in  southeast asia ,  east asia , africa, and  oceania  before cultural changes triggered by the spread of religions resulted in dog meat consumption declining and becoming more taboo. [ 216 ]   switzerland ,  polynesia , and  pre-columbian mexico  historically consumed dog meat. [ 217 ] [ 218 ] [ 219 ]  some  native american dogs , like the  peruvian hairless dog  and  xoloitzcuintle , were raised to be sacrificed and eaten. [ 220 ] [ 221 ]   han chinese  traditionally ate dogs. [ 222 ]  consumption of dog meat declined but did not end during the  sui dynasty  (581–618) and  tang dynasty  (618–907) due in part to the spread of buddhism and the upper class rejecting the practice. [ 223 ] [ 224 ]  dog consumption was rare in india, iran, and europe. [ 216 ] eating dog meat is a  social taboo  in most parts of the world, [ 225 ]  though some still consume it in  modern times . [ 226 ] [ 227 ]  it is still consumed in some  east asian  countries, including  china , [ 192 ]   vietnam , [ 193 ]   korea , [ 228 ]   indonesia , [ 229 ]  and the  philippines . [ 230 ]  an estimated 30 million dogs are killed and consumed in asia every year. [ 222 ]  china is the world's largest consumer of dogs, with an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs killed every year for human consumption. [ 231 ]  in vietnam, about 5 million dogs are slaughtered annually. [ 232 ]  in 2024, china, singapore, and thailand placed a ban on the consumption of dogs within their borders. [ 233 ]  in some parts of  poland [ 234 ] [ 235 ]  and  central asia , [ 236 ] [ 237 ]  dog fat is reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs. [ 238 ]  proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat. [ 239 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] [ 242 ] there is a long history of  dog meat consumption in south korea , but the practice has fallen out of favor. [ 243 ]  a 2017 survey found that under 40% of participants supported a ban on the distribution and consumption of dog meat. this increased to over 50% in 2020, suggesting changing attitudes, particularly among younger individuals. [ 7 ]  in 2018, the  south korean government  passed a bill banning restaurants that sell dog meat from doing so during that year's  winter olympics . [ 244 ]  on 9 january 2024, the  south korean parliament  passed a law banning the distribution and sale of dog meat. it will take effect in 2027, with plans to assist dog farmers in transitioning to other products. [ 245 ]  the primary type of dog raised for meat in south korea has been the  nureongi . [ 246 ]  in  north korea  where meat is scarce, eating dog is a common and accepted practice, officially promoted by the government. [ 247 ] [ 248 ]

 in 2018, the  world health organization  (who) reported that 59,000 people died globally from  rabies , with 59.6% of the deaths in asia and 36.4% in africa. rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most significant  vector . [ 249 ]  dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. [ 250 ]  the primary victims of dog bite incidents are children. they are more likely to sustain more serious injuries from bites, which can lead to death. [ 250 ]  sharp claws can lacerate flesh and cause serious infections. [ 251 ]   in the united states , cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. [ 252 ]  it has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in u.k. hospitals are domestic accidents. the same study concluded that dog-associated  road accidents  involving injuries more commonly involve  two-wheeled vehicles . [ 253 ]  some countries and cities have also banned or restricted certain dog breeds, usually for safety concerns. [ 254 ] toxocara canis  (dog  roundworm ) eggs in dog feces can cause  toxocariasis . it is estimated that nearly 14% of people in the united states are infected with  toxocara ; about 10,000 cases are reported each year. [ 255 ]  untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. [ 256 ]  dog feces can also contain  hookworms  that cause  cutaneous larva migrans  in humans. [ 257 ] [ 258 ] 
 health benefits 
 a woman walking a dog 
 the scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical and psychological well-being. [ 259 ]  studies suggest that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being, but they have been criticized for being "poorly controlled". [ 260 ] [ 261 ]  one study states that "the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and  social supports  but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal". [ 262 ]  earlier studies have shown that pet-dog or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and are less likely to be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties than non-guardians. [ 262 ]  people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these effects are relatively long-term. [ 263 ]  pet guardianship has also been associated with increased survival in cases of  coronary artery disease . human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute  myocardial infarction  than those who do not own dogs. [ 264 ]  studies have found a small to moderate correlation between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity levels. [ 265 ] a 2005 paper by the  british medical journal  states: [ 259 ] recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular disease , a reduced use of  general practitioner  services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. research has, however, pointed to significantly less  absenteeism  from school through sickness among children who live with pets. health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. for example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety [ 266 ]  and are exposed to  immune-stimulating microorganisms , which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases (according to the  hygiene hypothesis ). other benefits include dogs as social support. [ 267 ] one study indicated that wheelchair-users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not. [ 268 ]  in a 2015 study, it was found that having a pet made people more inclined to foster positive relationships with their neighbors. [ 269 ]  in one study, new guardians reported a significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, which was sustained through the 10-month study. [ 263 ] using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late-18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with  mental disorders . [ 270 ]  animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase smiling and laughing among people with  alzheimer's disease . [ 271 ]  one study demonstrated that children with adhd and  conduct disorders  who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, knowledge, and skill-objectives and decreased  antisocial  and  violent behavior  compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.

 cerberus  with the gluttons in  dante 's  third circle of hell , depicted by  william blake 
 artworks have depicted dogs as symbols of  guidance ,  protection ,  loyalty ,  fidelity ,  faithfulness ,  alertness , and  love . [ 273 ]  in ancient  mesopotamia , from the  old babylonian period  until the  neo-babylonian period , dogs were the symbol of  ninisina , the goddess of healing and medicine, [ 274 ]  and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. [ 274 ]  in the  neo-assyrian  and neo-babylonian periods, dogs served as emblems of magical protection. [ 274 ]  in  china ,  korea , and  japan , dogs are viewed as kind protectors. [ 275 ] in mythology, dogs often appear as pets or as watchdogs. [ 275 ]  stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout indo-european mythologies [ 276 ] [ 277 ]  and may originate from  proto-indo-european traditions . [ 276 ] [ 277 ]  in  greek mythology ,  cerberus  is a three-headed,  dragon -tailed watchdog who guards the gates of  hades . [ 275 ]  dogs also feature in association with the greek goddess  hecate . [ 278 ]  in  norse mythology , a dog called  garmr  guards  hel , a  realm of the dead . [ 275 ]  in  persian mythology , two four-eyed dogs guard the  chinvat bridge . [ 275 ]  in  welsh mythology ,  cŵn annwn  guards  annwn . [ 275 ]  in  hindu mythology ,  yama , the god of death, owns two watchdogs named  shyama and sharvara , which each have four eyes—they are said to watch over the gates of  naraka . [ 279 ]  a black dog is considered to be the  vahana  (vehicle) of  bhairava  (an incarnation of shiva). [ 280 ] in  christianity , dogs represent faithfulness. [ 275 ]  within the  roman catholic  denomination specifically, the iconography of  saint dominic  includes a dog after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and became pregnant shortly after that. [ 281 ]  as such, the  dominican order  ( ecclesiastical latin :  domini canis ) means "dog of the lord" or "hound of the lord". [ 281 ]  in christian folklore, a  church grim  often takes the form of a black dog to guard christian churches and their  churchyards  from  sacrilege . [ 282 ]   jewish law  does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets but requires jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and to make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them. [ 283 ] [ 284 ]  the view on dogs in  islam  is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing them as unclean, [ 275 ]  although  khaled abou el fadl  states that this view is based on "pre-islamic arab mythology" and "a tradition [...] falsely attributed to the prophet". [ 285 ]  the sunni  maliki school  jurists disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean. [ 286 ]
